# calculator


Things that gave me trouble : 

The first issue that I ran into was the fact that I tried to give each button have their own click event..... that would have been ugly... 

Turns out you can just use the innertext to get the information from it! great to know LOL. 

The evaluation function gave me some trouble because for some reason I forgot to the return the value of the sum after the operations too place. 

Current thing giving me issues is doing the operation instantly after there being 2 operators in the calculator.
